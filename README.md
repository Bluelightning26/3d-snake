# Cube
**Made at Undercity!**

In this custom rendition of the classic game of snake we overhauled the experience. With features including a score counter, high score display, speaker, sound effect buzzer, calibrated joystick, and most importantly a custom implementation of a cubic matrix display that recognizes directionality among much more, there is plenty of fun to be had :) The whole console also rotates using a stepper motor when the snake slithers across displays so the user can always see where the snake is!

## How to Play
The console utilize a joystick for controls. Moving it around helps orientate your snake! You'll die if you either hit the ground or if you back into yourself. You get a point if you slither into an apple. 

Depending on the version of game played, if you eat a mystery apple (orange and purple) you will either get a speed boost or a slowness effect.
